## Disable similar channels

### Collapse similar channels

Collapses recommendations block by default (upon joining a channel) 

### Hide similar channels tab

Removes similar channels tab from UI.

## Disable notify delay

*Notification delaying is a Telegram built-in function that delays notifications on the current client instance if you're online from another client.*

You can disable it if you want.

## Icon Picker

Lets you change application's icon, just like on **Android**.

!!! Windows note
If it doesn't change the taskbar icon when AyuGram is pinned, make sure the created shortcut named `AyuGram.lnk` or `AyuGram Desktop.lnk`.
!!!

!!!
On Windows, you can provide your own icon, by replacing `%appdata%/AyuGram.ico`.
!!!

## Hide notification counters

Removes count badges on the folders.

## Hide "All chats" folder

As the title says.

Implementation taken from **64Gram**.

## Context Menu Elements

Lets you change AyuGram's menu items.

Choosing "Extended menu" for an option means you'll have to press CTRL or SHIFT when opening context menu to see that.

## Mono Font

Which font to use for mono text.

## Confirmations

Simply show a box with confirmation before sending a message.

## Streamer Mode

This one hides AyuGram windows and notifications from capture apps. It means that you can enable screensharing (e.g. in Discord) and nobody will see your messages and dialogs.
Depending on Windows' mood, it'll be displayed either as a black box or as 'nothing'. literally.

Context menus are still visible.
