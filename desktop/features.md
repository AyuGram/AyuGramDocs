# Features

## Register URL Scheme (in three dots)

Associates Telegram links to be open in AyuGram Desktop.

## Message Shot

Select a few messages, and on the top bar there will be a "Shot" button.

Allows you to quickly create *screenshots* of messages with desired theming and options.

## Upload speed boost

Decreases delay between uploading file parts & increases buffer size.

Shortly, makes uploading faster.

Implementation taken from **Kotatogram**.

## Disable similar channels

### Collapse similar channels

Collapses recommendations block by default (upon joining a channel) 

### Hide similar channels tab

Removes similar channels tab from UI.

## Disable notify delay

*Notification delaying is a Telegram built-in function that delays notifications on the current client instance if you're online from another client.*

You can disable it if you want.

## Icon Picker

Lets you change application's icon, just like on **Android**.

!!! Windows note
If it doesn't change the taskbar icon when AyuGram is pinned, make sure the created shortcut named `AyuGram.lnk` or `AyuGram Desktop.lnk`.
!!!

## Hide notification counters

Removes count badges on the folders.

## Hide "All chats" folder

As the title says.

Implementation taken from 64Gram.

## Context Menu Elements

Lets you change AyuGram's menu items.

Choosing "Extended menu" for an option means you'll have to press CTRL or SHIFT when opening context menu to see that.

## Fonts

You can change application fonts here.

The best thing you can doâ€”*leave Application font as is* and *just change Monospace font*. Just trust me, it's better in that way.

## Confirmations

Simply show a box with confirmation before sending a message.

## Streamer Mode

Imagine yourself streaming how you play in **Discord**. Lobby, *full of your friends*. And then, you receive a message from your mum, like, *"THE DINNER IS READY MY DEAREST SON LET'S GO EAT"*, and **this message appearing on your screen demonstration**. Funny for your friends, *but maybe not for you*, right?

If you enable this feature, notifications and any AyuGram windows will be hidden **completely** from **any** capture app, not even displaying a single pixel of it.
