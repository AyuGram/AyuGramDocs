# Features

## Disable notify delay

*Notification delaying is a Telegram built-in function that delays notifications on the current client instance if you're online from another client.*

You can disable it if you want.

## Customization > Icon Picker

Let's you change application's icon, just like on **Android**.

!!! Windows note
If it doesn't change the taskbar icon when AyuGram is pinned, make sure the created shortcut named `AyuGram.lnk` or `AyuGram Desktop.lnk`.
!!!

## Show ghost mode toggle

Shows a Ghost Mode toggle in the **tray menu** and **drawer**.

## Fonts

You can change application fonts here.

The best thing you can doâ€”*leave Application font as is* and *just change Monospace font*. Just trust me, it's better in that way.

## Confirmations

Simply show a box with confirmation before sending a message.

## Show streamer mode toggles

Imagine yourself streaming how you play in **Discord**. Lobby, *full of your friends*. And then, you receive a message from your mum, like, *"THE DINNER IS READY MY DEAREST SON LET'S GO EAT"*, and **this message appearing on your screen demonstration**. Funny for your friends, *but maybe not for you*, right?

If you enable this feature, notifications and any AyuGram windows will be hidden **completely** from **any** capture app, not even displaying a single pixel of it.
