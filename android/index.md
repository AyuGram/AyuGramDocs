# AyuGram for Android

**AyuGram4A** is a fork of **[exteraGram](https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram)** with ToS breaking features.
These can't be implemented in **exteraGram** directly, because **exteraSquad** will lose their API keys.

### Which one should I use?

If you don't care about ToS breaking features, use **exteraGram**.

If you do, use **AyuGram**.

## Features

- Full ghost mode (flexible)
- Messages history (flexible)
- Forward from restricted channels (AyuForward)
- Message filters (e.g. hide ads, blocked users)
- No emulator detection
- No Telegram ads & proxy sponsor
- Keep in cache chats where you were banned/kicked
- Built with official keys
- Screenshots in secret chats
- Expire button for TTL photos/videos
- Local Telegram Premium

Note that we use **Crashlytics**.
If you don't want to send crash reports, you can disable it in **exteraGram Preferences**.

## Localization

We have our own **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ayugram)**.

But since **AyuGram** is based on **exteraGram**, also join their project
at **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/exteralocales)**!
