# AyuGram for Android

**AyuGram4A** is a fork of **[exteraGram](https://github.com/exteraSquad/exteraGram)** with ToS breaking features.
These can't be implemented in **exteraGram** directly, because **exteraSquad** will lose their API keys.

### Which one should I use?

**AyuGram** shares the same codebase with **exteraGram**.

With **exteraGram** you'll get frequent and fast updates. It's more stable.

With **AyuGram** you'll get ToS breaking features, no more.

## Main Features

- Ghost Mode
- Messages History
- Message Filters (Hide Ads & Blocked Users)
- Forward from Restricted Channels (AyuForward)
- Local Telegram Premium

## Small Things

- Built with Official Keys
- Removed Telegram Ads & Proxy Sponsor
- Screenshots in Secret Chats & for Secret Media
- Expire Button for Expiring Photos and Videos
- Banned or Kicked out Chats are Kept in Cache

Note that we use **Crashlytics**.
If you don't want to send crash reports or participate in analytics, you can disable it in **exteraGram Preferences**.

## Localization

We have our own **[Crowdin](https://translate.ayugram.one)**.

But since **AyuGram** is based on **exteraGram**, also join their project
at **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/exteralocales)**!
