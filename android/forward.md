# AyuForward

It's a feature that allows you to forward messages from **noforwards** channels. It also works for deleted messages.

It will **automatically** download media on your device, and forward messages without an author.

It's turned on by default. *Just try to forward something restricted.*

To cancel forwading, long press on the input field with the status.
