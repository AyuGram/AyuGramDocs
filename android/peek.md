# Peek Online

This function allows you to get user's last online **under certain circumstances**. Can be found in **three dots**.

Let's look at some examples.

1. You're **hiding** your online, and the person you want to check - **not**. In this case, **AyuGram** adds the person to the exclusions list, gets online and removes him back.
2. The person you want to check **hides** his online, but it has one of your accounts on the **exclusions list**. In this case, **AyuGram** gets online from the excluded account.

In the 2 option, **AyuGram** will try to add person to the excluded/included list on all accounts.

If your other accoutns haven't ever seen the user you're trying to peek on, he should have a username to make it possible get his profile.

Don't spam the button. This function makes a lot of requests in the 2 option.
