# AyuGram

*The best that could be in the world of Telegram clients.*

**AyuGram** is a Telegram client with a very pleasant features. Moreover, it has **Android** and **Desktop** versions.

!!!WARNING
It is extremely advanced client. You'll have to spend **a lot** of your time exploring all features.
If you're not ready to waste your time on tests - better **stick up with another client**.

Also, it consumes a lot of RAM, so if you have a potato phone - don't even try.
!!!

!!!
Note that our client **breaks [developer Telegram ToS](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms#1-privacy-amp-security)**, implementing features as:
- Saving deleted messages and history
- Ghost Mode
- Seeing self-destructing messages after expiring
- Message filters

***AyuGram** pretends to be an official application to Telegram. If you look at the list of sessions, you'll see yourself using a **regular** Telegram rather than AyuGram.
Generally, developer ToS apply only to developers, by restricting their application keys. But since we're using official ones, Telegram can't block our client. And since it's applied only to developers, they can't ban you, except if you're doing bad things that violate [user ToS](https://telegram.org/tos).
But as we've seen a lot of times, the Telegram team likes to change rules without warnings.*

So, we just have to say that:

> **We are not responsible for the possible blocking of your account. Use the client at your own risk.**
